Please note: This is still currently under construction and is within the early versions of Astera! If you find any errors, please open an `issue <https://github.com/tek256/astera/issues/>`_ or submit a `pull request <https://github.com/tek256/astera/compare>`_!

OS Specific Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tho you shouldn't notice any difference in implementation, on Windows Astera uses OpenAL-Soft's binaries instead of searching for any OpenAL SDK. This is meant to remove a lot of the issues Windows seems to have with OpenAL.
