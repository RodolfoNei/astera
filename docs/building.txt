So, you want to compile this great library and try to use it yourself?
Depending on which operating system you're using this process will change slightly.

If you prefer the automated route, you can do the following:
Windows - run tool/win_setup.ps1
Linux/Unix - run tool/unix_setup

If you want to manually compile the library & dependencies there here is how:
Note: For the following steps make sure that you have your terminal open and in the directory of astera.
-- Windows --
cd dep/openal-soft
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" (You can subsitute the cmake generator type with your own preferred)
make (if using MinGW, use mingw32-make instead)
(If you want to install the libraries locally, make sure you have the terminal open as administrator) make install

cd ../glfw
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles"
make
(optional) make install

cd ../..
make

-- Linux / Unix --
For linux, you have to have a few packages installed already. You can get most of these packages by installing your available version of `xorg-dev`. Otherwise, here is a list of the libraries / packages you'll need: `libGL`, `libGLU`, `libXi`, `X11`, `Xrandr`, `Xxf86vm`, `Xinerama`, `libDL`, `Xcursor`. 
If any of the listed packages are installed but not working, try installing the dev/devel version.
By default, astera compiles with `clang` on all platforms except Windows.

cd dep/openal-soft
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
make 
sudo make install (optional)

cd ../glfw/
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
make
sudo make install (optional)

cd ../../
make


-- Notes --
If you want to target a specific compiler for your system without using astera's default target compiler, you can run `make CC=compiler_here`
If you have any issues with these build steps, please open an issue or join the discord (https://tek256.com/discord) and I or one of the community members will try to point you in the right direction.
