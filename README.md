	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>The goal of this repository is to show that you're able to make a cross platform game engine in C. The idea is to provide an education resource for those interested in game engine / game development in general. Lots of the systems can be made from scratch, but for simplicity's sake, the early versions will use outside dependencies. In future updates, the systems may be migrated to our own in house made & maintained systems.
