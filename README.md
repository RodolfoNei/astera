### About
Astera is a 2D game library written in C99 focused on performance, portability, and maintainability. Astera aims to rely on as few dependencies as possible.  

#### Latest Release: 1.0-PRE

**NOTE: 1.0 PRE means that just about everything is finished, not all functionality is bug free**

### In Progress
NOTE: This section only exists for `-PRE` versions.

```
- Removing OpenAL in favor of MiniAudio
- Adding CRC32 intrinsic & software versions
- More accurate & in depth documentation
- Collision resolution debugging
- Complex collision detection & resolution
- Clean up code warnings
```

### Target Platforms
Here are the target platforms for this library:  
```
- Windows
- Linux
- Mac OSX (NOTE: Currently audio is unsupported on Mac)
- BSD
``` 

_NOTE: I'm always open to adding more target platforms!_

### Libraries Used
[GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw), [GLAD](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb/) Image & Vorbis, [nanovg](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg).

### Building
Astera and it's dependencies are built using CMake. You can run your own CMake command or try using one of the automated build scripts (they're located in the `tools/` folder).

```
Usage build_unix.sh && build_win.bat [-hrcxqq]
-h  Show this info
-r  Build release (optimizations, -O2)
-c  Build clean (remove previous build generated by this script)
-x  Don't build examples
-q  Quiet output
-qq Silence all output
Windows Only:
-m  Force use MinGW (gcc/g++)
-l  Force use LLVM (clang/clang++)
```

Example script usage (generate a release candidate):

```
./build_unix.sh -r
```

Example CMake usage:

```
cmake -Bbuilld -S. 
cmake --build build
```

NOTE: Once the build files are generated (first line) you only have to call `cmake --build build` to rebuild the source.

For more information see the relevant [wiki page](https://tek256.com/astera/Build%20Guide.html) or the `docs/Build Guide.rst` file.
