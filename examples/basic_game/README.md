### Basic Game Example

This game is meant to be a simple breakout game example!

### Assets Used
`resources/audio/somewhere.ogg` is from a CC0 music pack by [lunalucid](https://lunalucid.itch.io/free-creative-commons-bgm-collection) on itch\.io! You can find their work on soundcloud as well at [DeadSeed](https://soundcloud.com/deadseed).

`resources/textures/breakout.png` is just some grubby pack of things I made in order to try and make everything look half decent!  
`resources/audio/breakout_hit.wav`, `resources/audio/breakout_break.wav`, and `resources/audio/breakout_bounce.wav` are sounds I generated / tweaked using [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)!
